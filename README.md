# Resume.AI
Here, I am building an AI Application that can analyse resume vs Job Descriptions and draw Insights

- Files that we intend to create are ``app.py`` with another file as ``analysis.py`` that can have the prompts and genai model followed by ``pdf.py`` which will capture the pdf file and extract the resume text
- ``.env`` to store the gemini api key
- ``requirements.txt`` to store the libraries needed for the app.

- Activate venv using the following code: 
``source .venv/Scripts/activate``
``pip install -r requirements.txt``
